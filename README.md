After 1 month of work, a new BTScript version is avaible in beta, this is version is just for showing the new syntax and the new systems you can access it on the BTScript_Beta_Branch Repo (https://github.com/SquidyDev/BTScript_Beta_Branch).
The code will be moved to the Official Repo when it's beginning to work great.
